## &#10162; Basic Syntax:
This will instruct about Sass syntax and project setting up information.

### &#9780; Overview:
1. [Syntax Types](#-syntax-types)
2. [Setting up](#-setting-up)
3. [Comments](#-comments)
4. [File Paths](#-file-paths)

### &#10022; Syntax Types:
It supports two types of syntaxes.

**SCSS (Sassy CSS):**

- This follows CSS-like syntax with extensions.
- This is easier and readable.
*Example:*
```css
$primary-color: blue;

.button {
   background-color: $primary-color;
   padding: 10px 15px;
}
```

**Sass (Indented Syntax):**

- This uses indentation to define blocks.
- This is more concise and minimalistic.
*Example:*
```css
$primary-color: blue;

.button
   background-color: $primary-color
   padding: 10px 15px
```

### &#10022; Setting Up:
A typical Sass project will follow similar structure, which might look like below:
```
project/
  styles/
    _variables.scss
    _mixins.scss
    _base.scss
    main.scss
```

**For large-scale projects:**

```
project/styles/
  layout/
    _layout.scss
    _header.scss
    _footer.scss
    _sidebar.scss
  components/
    _button.scss
    _form.scss
    _card.scss
    _modal.scss
    _table.scss
  utilities/
    _utilities.scss 
  _base.scss
  _typography.scss
  _colors.scss
  _mixins.scss
  _functions.scss
  main.scss
```

- `layout` directory is place for different chunks of styles for different sections. 
	- `_layout.scss` contains overall layout styles such as grid system, containers and spacing.
	- `_header.scss` contains styles implementation for header section
	- `_footer.scss` contains styles implementation for footer section
	- `_sidebar.scss` contains styles implementation for sidebar section 

- `components` directory is place for different chunks of styles for different components. 
	- `_button.scss` contains styles for the button components might reused through out the project.
	- `_form.scss` contains styles for the form components might reused through out the project.
	- `_card.scss` contains styles for the card components might reused through out the project.
	- `_modal.scss` contains styles for the modal components might reused through out the project.
	- `_table.scss` contains styles for the table components might reused through out the project.

- `utilities` directory is place for different chunks of styles for different utilities. 
	- `_utilities.scss` contains classes for common styles like margin, padding, text alignment.

- `project/styles` directory is place for base styles and their resources. 
	- `_variables.scss` contains global variables to be used through out the project.
	- `_base.scss` contains global styles like resets, typography and color palettes.
	- `_typography.scss` contains styles including font size, line height, font families.
	- `_colors.scss` defines theme and color palettes.
	- `_mixins.scss` contains reusable mixins for common styles like border-radius, box-shadow, transitions.
	- `_functions.scss` defines custom functions.
	- `main.scss` is the root and main style file for overall project which organize all other styles and resources.

### &#10022; Comments:
Sass supports two types of comments:

**Single-line comments:**
```scss
// This is a single-line comment
```

**Multi-line comments:**
```scss
/*
This is a 
multi-line comment
*/
```

### &#10022; File Paths:

Sass stylesheets loads other Sass files by URL of the file path. This means instructed to use forward slashes `/` rather than backslashes `\` on any operating systems.

URLs are case-sensitive. As the same, Sass will consider `Base.scss` and `base.scss` to be different eventhough on a case-insensitive filesystem. Make sure the Sass file names and URLs match the actual names and URLs on disk, or this will might load twice or wonâ€™t work.

Sass can load other stylesheet as relative to the current file first. If it not exist then it proceed with defined load path. Make sure the file name conflict with other Sass stylesheet.

Relative imports can be supported and does not require to use `./` relative import URL. 

Sass has a feature of [Partials](./partials.md). It means to load other stylesheet as modules and not to be compiled.

Sass can find `_index.scss` or `_index.sass` in a directory and it will be loaded automatically when mention the URL for the directory itself rather than mentioning custom entry point for styles.
